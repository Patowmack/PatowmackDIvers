#### Wednesday, November 4 at Virtual Happy Hour at 7:00 pm, Virtual Meeting at 7:30 pm

Ben Scheelk with the Ocean Foundation will talk and show pictures of
their Sea Grass Grow program. The SeaGrass Grow campaign is a carbon
offset program that allows people to purchase carbon offset credits that
funds seagrass planting. Seagrass habitats are up to 45 times more
effective than the most pristine Amazonian rainforest in their carbon
uptake abilities and provide protection and shelter to ocean habitat.
For every \$1 invested in coastal restoration projects, \$15 in net
economic benefits is created. By utilizing this unique carbon offset
program, The Ocean Foundation has been able to combat ocean
acidification, a result of carbon produced climate change, as well as
help restore ocean habitat, and support the local communities that
depend on ocean health.

Aboard the Titanic" Once heralded as the grand, unsinkable ocean liner
of the sea in 1912, the RMS Titanic sailed into legend after striking an
iceberg and disappearing into oblivion, more than two miles on the ocean
floor. Seventy-three years later, scientists discovered the dead wreck
only to uncover a hidden ecosystem of sea life, from finless fish to
wood-boring organisms. Board the RMS Titanic once again to discover the
unique lifeforms that have inhabited the legendary ocean liner for more
than century.
