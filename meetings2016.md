### Wednesday, April 6

::: {.w3-container}
Gloria will show a video from her liveaboard off Socorro. Diving around
Socorro is usually done on a liveaboard and has been called the Mexican
Gallapagos (of course Cocos Islands have been called the Gallapagos of
Central America, and there is only one group of islands known as the
Gallapagos). But Socorro is closer to Washington than the real
Gallapagos, so come find out how close Socorro is to the real thing.

Brad will show pictures and talk about his recent dive trip to the Mayan
Riviera, better known as the Yucatan in Mexico. We will also discuss
past dive trips (a liveaboard from St. Maarten) and future dive trips
(Bonaire, Key West, and others).

We will have a social half hour starting at 7:00 PM. This is a chance to
talk, order drinks and food, etc. The meeting will start at 7:30. Our
meetings usually end between 9:00 and 9:30 PM.
