[http://www.fsisac.com Financial Services - Information Sharing and Analysis Center (FS-ISAC)] Sharing Critical, Authoritative Information Across a Range of Industry Players... Instantly
Launched in 1999, FS-ISAC was established by the financial services sector in response to 1998's Presidential Directive 63. That directive - later updated by 2003's Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7 - mandated that the public and private sectors share information about physical and cyber security threats and vulnerabilities to help protect the U.S. critical infrastructure.

[https://www.fsscc.org/fsscc/ Financial Services Sector Coordinating Council for Critical Infrastructure Protection and Homeland Security (FSSCC)], established in 2002, is the sector coordinator for Financial Services for the protection of critical infrastructure, focused on operational risks. Because the FSSCC fits into a larger network of industry / sector coordinating councils, it is uniquely positioned as the leader within financial services for developing strategies to improve shared critical infrastructure and homeland security. The FSSCC's mission is further supported by Homeland Security Presidential Directive #7, which directs government agencies to identify and protect critical infrastructure. The FSSCC works closely with the Treasury as its designated Sector Specific Agency (SSA), establishing a strong public-private partnership to maintain a robust sector that is resilient against manmade or natural incidents. Members commit their time and resources to FSSCC with a sense of responsibility to their individual firms and for the benefit of consumers and the country's populace.

*[http://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/other-reports/files/housing-white-paper-20120104.pdf The U.S. Housing Market: Current Conditions and Policy Considerations]The ongoing problems in the U.S. housing market continue to impede the economic recovery. House prices have fallen an average of about 33 percent from their 2006 peak, resulting in about $7 trillion in household wealth losses and an associated ratcheting down of aggregate consumption. At the same time, an unprecedented number of households have lost, or are on the verge of losing, their homes. The extraordinary problems plaguing the housing market reflect in part the effect of weak demand due to high unemployment and heightened uncertainty. But the problems also reflect three key forces originating from within the housing market itself: a persistent excess supply of vacant homes on the market, many of which stem from foreclosures; a marked and potentially long-term downshift in the supply of mortgage credit; and the costs that an often unwieldy and inefficient foreclosure process imposes on homeowners, lenders, and communities.

==Reinhart and Rogoff Arguments or Financial Crisis Are Different==
*[http://www.nber.org/papers/w15524.pdf?new_window=1 From Great Depression to Great Credit Crisis: Similarities, Differences and Lessons] The Great Depression of the 1930s and the Great Credit Crisis of the 2000s had similar causes but elicited strikingly different policy responses. It may still be too early to assess the effectiveness of current policy responses, but it is possible to analyze monetary and fiscal policies in the 1930s as a “natural experiment” or “counterfactual” capable of shedding light on the impact of recent policies. We employ vector autoregressions, instrumental variables, and qualitative evidence for a panel of 27 countries in the period 1925-1939. The results suggest that monetary and fiscal stimulus was effective – that where it did not make a difference it was not tried. The results also shed light on the debate over fiscal multipliers in episodes of financial crisis. They are consistent with multipliers at the higher end of those estimated in the recent literature, consistent with the idea that the impact of fiscal stimulus will be greater when banking system are dysfunctional and monetary policy is constrained by the zero bound. 

*[http://www.nber.org/papers/w18290.pdf?new_window=1 The Great Leveraging] What can history tell us about the relationship between the banking system, financial crises, the global economy, and economic performance? Evidence shows that in the advanced economies we live in a world that is more financialized than ever before as measured by importance of credit in the economy. I term this long-­run evolution “The Great Leveraging” and present a ten-point examination of its main contours and implications.

*[http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.26.3.69 Public Debt Overhangs: Advanced- Economy Episodes Since 1800] The recent fi nancial crisis and recession has left a legacy of historically high and rising level of public indebtedness across the advanced economies.  The central policy debate across Europe, Japan, and the United SGtates now centers on how fast to stabilize soaring public debt/GDP ratios, given that post-crisis growth remains fragile. We bring evidence to bear on the issue by identifying the major public debt overhang episodes in advanced economies since the early 1800s.  Following Reinhart and Rogoff (2010), we select stretches where gross public debt exceeds 90 percent of nominal GDP on a sustained basis. Such public debt overhang episodes are associated with lower growth than during other periods. Even more striking, among the 26 episodes we identify, 20 lasted more than a decade. The long duration belies the view that the correlation is caused mainly by debt buildups during business cycle recessions. The long duration also implies that the cumulative shortfall in output from debt overhang is potentially massive. These growth-reducing effects of high public debt are apparently not transmitted exclusively through high real interest rates, in that in eleven of the episodes, interest rates are not materially higher.

*[http://www.voxeu.org/article/time-different-again-us-five-years-after-onset-subprime-0 This time is different, again? The US five years after the onset of subprime] The strength of the US recovery has become a political issue in the presidential election. The US is doing better than other advanced economies, but famous economists associated with the Romney campaign claim this is not good enough. The US, they argue, is different. Here, the masters of the 'this time is different' research genre – Carmen Reinhart and Ken Rogoff – argue that US historical performance is not different when it is properly measured, so the economy’s performance is better than expected.

*[http://www.nber.org/papers/w13761.pdf?new_window=1 Is the 2007 U.S. Sub-Prime Financial Crisis So Different? An International Historical Comparison] Is the 2007-2008 U.S. sub-prime mortgage financial crisis truly a new and different phenomena? Our examination of the longer historical record finds stunning qualitative and quantitative parallels to 18 earlier post-war banking crises in industrialized countries. Specifically, the run-up in U.S. equity and housing prices (which, for countries experiencing large capital inflows, stands out as the best leading indicator in the financial crisis literature) closely tracks the average of the earlier crises. Another important parallel is the inverted v-shape curve for output growth the U.S. experienced as its economy slowed in the eve of the crisis. Among other indicators, the run-up in U.S. public debt and is actually somewhat below the average of other episodes, and its pre-crisis inflation level is also lower. On the other hand, the United States current account deficit trajectory is worse than average. A critical question is whether the U.S. crisis will prove similar to the most severe industrialized-country crises, in which case growth may fall significantly below trend for an extended period. Or will it prove like one of the milder episodes, where the recovery is relatively fast? Much will depend on how large the shock to the financial system proves to be and, to a lesser extent, on the efficacy of the subsequent policy response.

*[http://www.nber.org/papers/w13946.pdf?new_window=1 The Forgotten History of Domestic Debt] There is a rich scholarly literature on sovereign default on external debt. Comparatively little is known about sovereign defaults on domestic debt. Even today, cross-country data on domestic public debt remains curiously exotic, particularly prior to the 1980s. We have filled this gap in the literature by compiling a database on central government public debt (external and domestic). The data span 1914 to 2007 for most countries, reaching back into the nineteenth century for many. Our findings on debt sustainability, sovereign defaults, the temptation to inflate, and the hierarchy of creditors only scratch the surface of what the domestic public debt data can reveal. First, domestic debt is big -- for the 64 countries for which we have long time series, domestic debt accounts for almost two-thirds of total public debt. For most of the sample, this debt carries a market interest rate (except for the financial repression era between WWII and financial liberalization). Second, the data go a long ways toward explaining the puzzle of why countries so often default on their external debts at seemingly low debt thresholds. Third, domestic debt has largely been ignored in the vast empirical work on inflation. In fact, domestic debt (a significant portion of which is long term and non-indexed) is often much larger than the monetary base in the run-up to high inflation episodes. Last, the widely-held view that domestic residents are strictly junior to external creditors does not find broad support.
*[http://www.economics.harvard.edu/faculty/rogoff/files/Aftermath.pdf The Aftermath of Financial Crises] A year ago, we (Carmen M. Reinhart and Kenneth S. Rogoff, 2008a) presented a historical analysis comparing the run-up to the 2007 U.S. subprime financial crisis with the antecedents of other banking crises in advanced economies since World War II.  We showed that standard indicators for the United States, such as asset price inflation, rising leverage, large sustained current account deficits, and a slowing trajectory of economic growth, exhibited virtually all the signs of a country on the verge of a financial crisis--indeed, a severe one.  In this paper, we engage in a similar comparative historical analysis that is focused on the aftermath of systemic banking crises.

*[http://www.voxeu.org/article/debt-and-growth-revisited Debt and growth revisited] With the advanced economies at a critical juncture, some economists are urging more fiscal stimulus while others argue that raising debt levels will stunt growth. This column presents the Reinhart-Rogoff findings on the relationship between debt and growth based on data from 44 countries over 200 years with a focus on the debt-growth link during high-debt episodes.

*[http://scholar.harvard.edu/barro/files/wsj_recovery_12_0605.pdf Why Is This Recovery So Slow?] What's interfering with a real recovery? Perhaps the Obama administration should stop casting blame elsewhere and examine the policies it has implemented to ease the pain of recession and falling housing prices. (Some of those, to be fair, were initiated under the Bush administration.)

*[http://www.nber.org/papers/w17445.pdf Means-Tested Subsidies and Economic Performance Since 2007] The aggregate neoclassical growth model – with means-tested subsidies whose replacement rates began rising at the end of 2007 as its only impulse – produces time series or aggregate labor usage, consumption, investment, and real GDP that closely resemble actual U.S. time series. Despite having no explicit financial market, the model has investment fall steeply during the recession not because of any distortions with the supply of capital, but merely because labor is falling and labor is complementary with capital in the production function. Through the lens of the model, the fact that real consumption fell significantly below trend during 2008 suggests that labor usage per capita is expected to remain well below pre-recession levels for several years.

*[http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2012/201214/201214pap.pdf Mortgage Debt and Household Deleveraging:Accounting for the Decline in Mortgage Debt Using Consumer Credit Record Data] One of the major reasons hypothesized for the tepid economic recovery thus far is the ongoing “deleveraging” process. From 2009:Q3 to 2011:Q3, aggregate household debt declined by about $1.5 trillion in real terms, with mortgage debt falling by about $1 trillion. Other than defaults, the factors driving the decline in aggregate debt are not precisely understood, in large part because the necessary data are not widely available. This paper draws on panel data consisting of individual credit records to better understand why mortgage debt has declined. I decompose changes in aggregate mortgage debt over two-year periods spanning the past decade into inflows (from individuals whose mortgage debt increases during a given two-year period)and outflows (from those who reduce or eliminate their mortgage debt over a period). The principal finding is that the drop in outstanding mortgage debt has more to do with shrinking inflows than with expanding outflows, including defaults. Even if outflows had not grown at all, mortgage debt would have declined over the past two years because inflows have been so weak. One factor dampening inflows is historically weak first-time homebuying, especially among those with less-than-excellent credit scores, suggesting tight credit supply has limited debt accumulation even among those who have little debt. On the outflows side, most of the expansion can be traced to financially distressed borrowers and mortgage defaults, with real estate investors playing a disproportionate role. Otherwise, there has not been much of an increase in outflows, implying that borrowers generally are not paying down their balances more aggressively than in the past.

*[http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20120210a.pdf Bernanke:  Housing Markets in Transition] One of the effects of declines in housing wealth is to reduce the ability and willingness of households to spend. While estimates vary, homeowners are believed to spend somewhere between $3 and $5 per year less for every $100 of housing value lost.

*[http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/raskin20120412a.pdf Rankin: Downturns and Recoveries: What the Economies in Los Angeles and the United States Tell Us] Economic studies have found that the aftermath of a financial crisis is usually associated with substantial declines in output and employment and that it takes much longer to return to pre-crisis levels of economic activity.1 Recent research by staff at the Federal Reserve has shown that the current recovery from the financial crisis has been even slower than would have been expected.2 This unusually weak recovery can be at least partly explained by the large drop in house prices and severe slump in housing activity that played such a major role in the recent recession.

*[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/05/opinion/05geanokoplos.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 Matters of Principal] For subprime and other non-prime loans, which account for more than half of all foreclosures, the best thing to do for the homeowners and for the bondholders is to write down principal far enough so that each homeowner will have equity in his house and thus an incentive to pay and not default again down the line. This is also best for taxpayers, who now effectively guarantee the securities linked to these mortgages because of the various deals we’ve made to support the banks.

*[http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.24.4.3 Why Does the Economy Fall to Pieces after a Financial Crisis?] The worst financial crisis in the history of the United States and many other countries started in 1929. The Great Depression followed. The second-worst struck in the fall of 2008 and the Great Recession followed. Commentators have dwelt endlessly on the causes of these and other deep fifi nancial collapses.  Less conspicuous has been the macroeconomists’ concern about why output and employment collapse after a fifi nancial crisis and remain at low levels for several or many years after the crisis. This article pursues modern answers to that question. It focuses on events in the United States since 2008.  Existing macroeconomic models account successfully for the immediate effects of a fifi nancial crisis on output and employment. I will lay out a simple macro model that captures the most important features of modern models and show that realistic increases in fifi nancial frictions that occurred in the crisis of late 2008 will generate declines in real GDP and employment of the magnitude that occurred. But this model cannot explain why GDP and employment failed to recover once the fifi nancial crisis subsided—the model implies a recovery as soon as fifi nancial frictions return to normal. At the end of the article I will mention the ideas that are in play to explain the persistent adverse effects of temporary crises, but these ideas have not made their way into the mainstream model.  

*[http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aer.101.2.431 The Long Slump] In a market-clearing economy, declines in demand from one sector do not cause large declines in aggregate output because other sectors expand. The key price mediating the response is the interest rate.  A decline in the rate stimulates all categories of spending. But in a low-inflation economy, the room for a decline in the rate is small, because of the notorious lower limit of zero on the nominal interest rate. In the Great Depression, substantial deflation caused the real interest rate to reach high levels. In the Great Slump that began at the end of 2007, low inflation resulted in an only slightly negative real rate when full employment called for a much lower real rate because of declines in demand. Fortunately, the inflation rate hardly responded to conditions in product and labor markets, else deflation might have occurred, with an even higher real interest rate. I concentrate on three closely related sources of declines in demand: the buildup of excess stocks of housing and consumer durables, the corresponding expansion of consumer debt that financed the buildup, and financial frictions that resulted from the decline in real-estate prices.

*[http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.24.4.45 The Economic Crisis from a Neoclassical Perspective] The U.S. recession from 2007-2009 differs considerably from other postwar U.S. recessions and from the parallel recessions in other high-income countries like Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom. In the United States, lower output and income is exclusively due to a large decline in labor input. In contrast, lower output and income in many other U.S. recessions, and in the 2007-2009 recession in these other countries, are due to signififi cant productivity declines and much smaller declines in labor input. Figure 1 shows quarterly per capita hours worked in the United States between 1956-Q1 and 2009-Q2, with shading indicating recessions according to the dates assigned by the National Bureau of Economic Research. The fifi gure highlights the abnormally large labor decline in the 2007-2009 recession relative to earlier recession dates.  The analysis presented here indicates that the 2007-2009 recession is not wellunderstood within current classes of economic models, including both standard real business cycle models and, perhaps surprisingly, also including models in which fifi nancial distress reduces economic activity. Specififi cally, the 2007-2009 U.S.  recession and its aftermath requires-much like understanding the Great Depression- a theory for why the marginal rate of substitution between consumption and leisure was so low relative to the marginal product of labor. This means that labor input during the 2007-2009 recession in the United States was far below the level consistent with the marginal product of labor and indicates that the labor input would have changed very little after 2007 in the absence of this deviation.

*[http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.24.4.85 Macroeconomics after the Crisis: Time to Deal with the Pretense-of-Knowledge Syndrome] The recent financial crisis has damaged the reputation of macroeconomics, largely for its inability to predict the impending fifi nancial and economic crisis. To be honest, this inability to predict does not concern me much. It is almost tautological that severe crises are essentially unpredictable, for otherwise they would not cause such a high degree of distress. Of course, it is well-known that certain elements can increase the fragility of a fifi nancial system, such as high levels of leverage or mismatches between short-term liabilities and long-term assets, and that these issues may justify policy intervention. But knowing these mechanisms is quite different from arguing that a severe crisis can be predicted. Modern Cassandras will always claim to have seen the crisis coming. What they will not say is how many times they saw things coming that never materialized, or how the specififi c mechanisms behind the crisis are different from those on which their predictions were based.  In my view, the conviction that one can foretell a severe crisis in advance is mostly a manifestation of pareidolia-the psychological phenomenon that makes people see faces and animals in clouds and the like.  What does concern me about my discipline, however, is that its current core -by which I mainly mean the so-called dynamic stochastic general equilibrium approach-has become so mesmerized with its own internal logic that it has begun to confuse the precision it has achieved about its own world with the precision that it has about the real one.  

*[http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.26.2.189 Using Internet Data for Economic Research] The data used by economists can be broadly divided into two categories. First, structured datasets arise when a government agency, trade association, or company can justify the expense of assembling records. The Internet has transformed how economists interact with these datasets by lowering the cost of storing, updating, distributing, fifi nding, and retrieving this information. Second, some economic researchers affifi rmatively collect data of interest. Historically, assembling a dataset might involve delving through annual reports or archives that had not previously been organized into a format ready for research. In some cases researchers would survey stores, factories, consumers, or workers; or they could carry out an experiment. For researcher-collected data, the Internet opens exceptional possibilities both by increasing the amount of information available for researchers to gather and by lowering researchers’ costs of collecting information. In this paper, I will explore the Internet’s new datasets, present methods for harnessing their wealth, and survey a sampling of the research questions these data help to answer.

#From MBA:  The data in this report is drawn from the FDIC's Quarterly Banking Profile reports, which are available at:
http://www2.fdic.gov/qbp/index.asp
#2. The category commercial mortgages includes mortgages backed by both income-producing properties and
owner-occupied commercial properties. Mortgages on income-producing properties are dependent on rents and
leases to pay the debt service of the loan, whereas owner-occupied properties rely on the business income of the
owner-occupant.
#3. The names of the categories used in this report have been simplified from the names used in the FDIC Quarterly
Banking Profile (QBP). The following is a map of the names used in this report and the names used in the QBP.
###a. Construction loans Construction and development
***b. Commercial mortgages Nonfarm nonresidential
***c. Multifamily mortgages Multifamily residential real estate
***d. Home equity loans Home equity loans
***e. 1-4 family residential loans Other 1-4 family residential
***f. Commercial and industrial loans Commercial and industrial loans

 B2-2-03, Multiple Financed Properties for the Same Borrower (08/21/2012)
    Introduction
    This topic contains information on multiple financed properties for the same borrower, including:
        Loan and Borrower Requirements
        Limits on the Number of Financed Properties
        Applying the Multiple Financed Property Policy to DU Loan Casefiles
        Eligibility Requirements for Investor and Second Home Borrowers With Five to Ten Financed Properties
        Underwriting and Delivery Requirements for Investor and Second Home Borrowers with Five to Ten Financed Properties
        Exception for DU Refi Plus and Refi Plus
    Loan and Borrower Requirements
    A borrower may finance multiple properties if he or she is qualified and if the following requirements are met:
        The loan must comply with Fannie Mae’s limitations on the maximum number of financed properties, including ownership interests in financed properties, as well as eligibility, underwriting, delivery, and reserve requirements.
        The borrower must have sufficient assets to close after calculating reserve requirements. For minimum reserve requirements, see B3-4.1-01, Minimum Reserve Requirements (08/21/2012).
    Limits on the Number of Financed Properties
    If the mortgage being delivered to Fannie Mae is secured by the borrower’s principal residence, there are no limitations on the number of properties that the borrower can currently be financing. If the mortgage is secured by a second home or an investment property, the borrower may own or be obligated on up to ten financed properties (including his or her principal residence).
    Fannie Mae's standard eligibility and underwriting policies apply if the borrower is financing a second home or investment property and will have one to four financed properties; however, if the borrower will have five to ten financed properties, the mortgage loan must comply with the eligibility, underwriting, and delivery requirements described herein.
    Exception: HomeStyle Renovation mortgage loans are subject to the one to four financed property limitations (that is, the five to ten financed property limitation is not applicable).
    For additional policy considerations, see B3-3.1-08, Rental Income (05/15/2012), B3-4.1-01, Minimum Reserve Requirements (08/21/2012), and B3-6-05, Monthly Debt Obligations (05/24/2011).
    The financed property limit applies to the borrower's ownership of one- to four-unit financed properties or mortgage obligations on such properties and is cumulative for all borrowers. These limitations apply to the total number of properties financed, not to the number of mortgages on the property or the number of mortgages sold to Fannie Mae. Unless otherwise stated, these requirements apply to all mortgage loans whether underwritten manually or through DU.

Here is the summary I prepared of the committee conference call we had with Fannie.  Please let me know if you produce anything that would help us understand GSE condo policies as you see it.  Even if we have to get the report from a Member request.  Thanks.

Fannie Condo Policies

Representing Fannie Mae, Deborah Tretler and Jack King summarized Fannie Made condo policies and answered a series of questions.  Here are some of the key facts, from both the Realtor and the Fannie perspective, covered on the call:

Waivers Permitted; Lender Policies May Be the Problem.  Lenders may ask Fannie Mae to waive its national guidelines to accommodate particular local situations where a waiver makes sense.  Members indicated this fact is little know by many lenders and that lenders often are not interested in pursuing waivers.  Fannie indicated they approve waivers routinely, often within 24-48 hours because the system is electronic, but the decision whether to request a waiver is at the discretion of the lender.  Some lenders blame Fannie for policies that are lender policies and blame Fannie for inflexibility when it is the lender that is declining to request a waiver.

eFannieMae.com.  Fannie suggested that members can go to eFannieMae.com to find applicable Fannie policies.  This can be useful in challenging lenders who assert the problem is a Fannie policy when it is, in reality, a lender policy or lender confusion about the Fannie policy.  Members may sign up for an email service to be notified whenever Fannie modifies or adopts a new guideline.

Fannie FAQs.  Fannie is open to elaborating on various issues in its Frequently Asked Questions that it has adopted for various elements of its guidelines.

Presale Requirements for New Condo Projects.  The presale requirement requires for new (including newly converted) condo projects vary depending on the situation:

Lender Full Review (LFR). Where the project is approved by the lender under the LFR process, the presale requirement is 70%.

Project Eligibility Review Service (PERS).  Where Fannie approves the project using the PERS process, the presale requirement may be more flexible.  Fannie will require a presale requirement of either 51% or 70%, depending on the particular circumstances of the project.

Condo Project Manager (CPM) Expedited Review.  Where the lender approves the project using free CPM Expedited Review software, the presale requirement remains flexible down to 51%.

Owner-Occupancy Requirement for Investor Purchasers in Established Projects.  Fannie also has a 51% owner-occupancy requirement for established condo projects (essentially projects transferred from the developer to the condo board), but it only applies to investor transactions.  There is no
owner-occupancy requirement if the buyer will use the unit as a primary or secondary residence.

A member asked about the situation where a parent seeks to buy another unit in the project for use of an adult child.  Fannie said they would consider an exception since it is not an investor property (even though it is not occupied by the owner).  Another solution, suggested by a member, is to put title in the names of both the parent and the adult child, in which case it would be treated as owner-occupied.

Treatment of REO Units.  For REO (bank-owned) properties, Fannie treats REO units that are for sale (or will be for sale after eviction is complete) as owner-occupied for purposes of the owner-occupancy requirement.  REO units that the bank is renting out are, however,  treated as investor units.

Delinquent HOA Dues.  Fannie does not purchase condo loans if more than 15% of homeowner association dues payments are more than 30 days delinquent.  This applies to both new and established attached condominium projects.  As mentioned above, Fannie Mae can review exceptions to this requirement
on a project-by-project basis.

Legal Document Review No Longer Required.  Fannie has eased condo requirements by eliminating the requirement that lenders must represent and warrant that the project’s legal documents comply with certain requirements.  The elimination applies to established condo projects and new 2- to 4-unit condo projects.

Boat Slips.  Fannie staff agreed to follow up with a member on the treatment of boat slips as real estate as opposed to personal property.

Treatment of Time Shares  A member from Missouri asked about the treatment of projects  with a small number of time share units and separate financial records.  Fannie advised that the situations may vary widely and members should talk to the lender and keep in mind the waiver option.

Commercial Space Limit.  Fannie guidelines limit the amount of commercial space to 20%, but can review exceptions to this policy on a project-by-project basis.  The objective is to make sure there is an adequate market for the entire project, both commercial and residential.

Freddie Mac Policies.  Fannie indicated that it believes its policies are quite similar to Freddie’s policies.  On any individual questions, NAR can check with Freddie.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2655">Here’s what I’ve been able to pull together concerning you questions about federal government support for housing.

*A Financial Services committee print of housing laws 1892-2003 is available from GPO at http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/granule/CPRT-108HPRT92629/CPRT-108HPRT92629/content-detail.html .

CRS updated this committee print, but the update was never published.  I have attached a copy.

*FHFA’s annual report covers Fannie Mae (Table 4a) and Freddie Mac (Table 13a) is available at http://www.fhfa.gov/webfiles/24009/FHFA_RepToCongr11_6_14_508.pdf.  Their quarterly updated on Treasury’s support for the enterprises is at http://www.fhfa.gov/Default.aspx?Page=70.

I have a FHA spreadsheet on mortgages insured every year since 1935.  Dollars are the amounts recorded in those years, i.e. are not adjusted for inflation.

*The National Low Income Housing Coalition is an advocacy group and has put together a report on federal support for housing 1976-2005. You can get a copy at http://nlihc.org/sites/default/files/cp04.pdf.   As you and I talked on the phone, comparing budget numbers over a period of years because accounting systems move accounts around, rules change, and even somewhat routine events such as rescissions and offsetting receipts make tracking numbers on a consistent basis difficult.  If you want official budget numbers, Table 4.1—Outlays by Agency 1962-2017 is available from OMB at (http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/Historicals/ and http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2013/assets/hist04z1.xls).

*JCT has estimates of tax expenditures going back to 1972 at https://www.jct.gov/publications.html?func=select&amp;id=5.

*CBO has an issue brief on federal support for housing at http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/ftpdocs/105xx/doc10525/11-03-housingprograms.pdf , but it is limited to 2009.

*The Federal Reserve publishes “Flow of Funds” which includes agencies and GSEs.  See table L.122 at http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/current/annuals/a2005-2011.pdf.  Historical tables going back to 1945 are at http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/current/data.htm .

*Finally, there is the question of inflation.  In appropriations reports, CRS uses the GDP implicit price deflator, which BEA publishes at http://www.bea.gov/iTable/iTable.cfm?ReqID=9&amp;step=1#reqid=9&amp;step=3&amp;isuri=1&amp;910=X&amp;911=1&amp;903=13&amp;904=1929&amp;905=2012&amp;906=A.  See Table 1.1.9.  You may have to pick a custom time period.  This table uses 2005 as its base year.  To convert other years to 2005 dollars, divide by the GDP inflator divided by 100.  For example to convert a 2000 amount, divide by 0.88723.</text>

      <comment>/* Sales Price in Foreclosure */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2493">== Foreclosure Times ==

I haven't been able to find actual time to foreclosure, but I have found the time that F/F allow, which would reflect the speed in various states.
 

Here's a June 6 table from [https://www.efanniemae.com/sf/guides/ssg/relatedservicinginfo/pdf/foreclosuretimeframes.pdf.  Fannie Mae].  Maine is slow, but not the slowest.
 
Freddie Mac has a 2008 time line, but I can't get the URL (it's done in a strange way with AllRegs), so I've attached the time lines they issued in 2008 and those that will go into effect later this year.. Look at [http://www.allregs.com/tpl/Main.aspx AllRegs] for Servicing, Vol 2 Exhibit 83 (there are two).  Copies are in my docs file.
 
You might also look at RealtyTrac's [http://www.realtytrac.com/foreclosure-laws/foreclosure-laws-comparison.asp state-by-state summary], [http://www.realtytrac.com/trendcenter/ trends] and [http://www.realtytrac.com/foreclosure-laws/index.html foreclosure page].

Hi Eric, 

To answer your questions below: the term is 30 years. The interest rate caps are 2% per year and 6% over the life of the loan.  The index is the 1-year constant maturity Treasury bill. 

Let me know if you have any other questions and thanks for reaching out. 

Best,
Chad

Hi, 
Can you tell me what the various parameters are on the mortgages used in your 5-year (http://www.freddiemac.com/pmms/pmms5.htm) and 1-year ARMS?  Specifically, what is the term of the ARM, how much can the interest rate change annually and over the life of the mortgage, and what is the rate indexed to?

'' June 4, 2009:

public and private purposes
Hugh
Little debate over government support of housing: 
&quot;Even as Washington debated GSE oversight, there was little debate over the extent to which government should subsidize homeownership, and whether such government support was contributing to a housing bubble. The U.S. government has many policies that subsidize homeownership â€“ it would be oversimplifying and wrong to blame Fannie and Freddie for the bubble, but they clearly are part of the public policy bias that contributed to it.&quot;

&quot;Numerous long-standing indirect subsidies already exist, including the mortgage interest deduction, subsidized FHA mortgages, and the variety of other HUD programs that expand homeownership opportunities.&quot;

&quot;As a public policy tool to expand homeownership, the GSEs, like FHA-Ginnie Mae, reduce mortgage rates for borrowers by taking on the credit risk that mortgage investors would otherwise bear and guaranteeing that mortgage investors will be paid in full should the mortgage borrower default. As Congress considers the future role and structure of the GSEs, it must consider how much credit risk the Federal government should take.&quot;

&quot;(1) Expanded FHA/Ginnie Mae. ... Under this model, the GSEs could become a government entity, or their functions could be absorbed by FHA/Ginnie Mae .&quot;

&quot;2) Partial Guarantee. A hybrid of this would be to create a Ginnie Mae-like entity for non-FHA mortgages, structured as a partial guarantee mechanism. The new entity could operate on a similar basis as Ginnie Mae, but provide only partial guarantees for MBS.&quot;

&quot;(3) Privatization. A third alternative would be to remove all direct or indirect government support, completely privatizing these companies while breaking them up to minimize systemic risk. As appealing as this alternative sounds, it is difficult to envision a sound, practical, private sector mortgage insurance business of any significant size that does not require large amounts of capital, and consequently generates only a modest return on capital.&quot;

&quot;(4) Housing Utility. Finally, given traditional U.S. public policy support for marshalling private capital to expand homeownership, establishing a public utility-like mortgage credit guarantor could be the best way to resolve the inherent conflict between public purpose and private gain. Under a utility model, Congress would replace Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac with one or two private sector entities. The entities would purchase and securitize mortgages with a credit guarantee backed by the federal government, and would not have investment portfolios. These entities would be privately-owned, but governed by a rate setting commission that would establish a targeted rate of return, thereby addressing the inherent conflicts between private ownership and public purpose that are unresolved in the current GSE structure. This commission would also approve mortgage product and underwriting innovations to continually improve the availability of mortgage finance for a population to be defined by the Congress. In this model, continued safety and soundness regulation would be essential.&quot;

&quot;One way to do this is for the government to receive some compensation for its guarantee.&quot;

&quot;Covered bonds are another private sector alternative worth exploring. The FDIC has made regulatory changes to support the emergence of covered bonds, which could provide enhanced opportunities for depository institutions to fund and manage mortgage credit risk.&quot;

    I did some checking and can find no new CBO report of the cost of the purchase of GSE securities (bonds, MBS, senior 
  preferred stock, etc.).  My colleagues remind me that CBO does not go back an update their estimates once a bill becomes 
  a law.  The exception to this is the Budget and Economic Outlook, which can be downloaded at 
  http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/99xx/doc9957/01-07-Outlook.pdf.  You might look at Table 4.
    On the other hand, the Fed reports its purchases of agency (mostly GSE) debt and MBS at 
  http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h41/Current/.
    Treasury reports Housing and Economic Recovery Programs expenditures (mostly GSE) at http://fms.treas.gov/mts/ (page 13).
    The numbers require careful analysis because the government is both buying and selling securities.  This 
  is most clearly shown at the New York Fed's page on the purchase and sale of agency MBS:  
  http://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/mbs/index.html.
    Also, I update my report on the GSEs financial condition including Treasury purchase of senior preferred stock.

''
May 29, 2009:  Treasury:  $85 billion senior preferred, $167 billion MBS, $0 GSE liquidity.  Fed: $0 enterprise credit facility, $507 billion MBS, $81 billion GSE debt.  Total $85=40 billion.  Losses in Q1 were credit loses and provisions for future credit losses.

1. How can mortgage lending, including mortgage securitization, be changed to better
serve our society? What is the role of regulation in achieving that goal?
2. How can financial institutions involved in mortgage lending and their supervision
be reformed in order to protect overall financial stability better?
3. Beyond prudential regulation and supervision, does the government need to perform
directly any specific functions in the secondary mortgage market? If so, how could
the government best perform any such functions?

Potential roles:  secondary market liquidity of last resort, guarantor or catastrophic risk insurer, allocate susbidies. (p. 15)

Principles:  well defined, internally consistent roles, clear federal/priviate divisin, needs sound management, underwriting, etc; regulatory governance; institutional and system risk regulator

Structures:  agency (but will FHA work?); GSEs with explicit Treasury net worth guarantee or catastrophic risk reinsurance (see discussion p. 17).
utility model of Paulson, co-op model like FHLBanks; private with or without government backing..need standardization and uniform quality control

need macroprudential regulation  &quot;We believe that the Enterprises' approach to meeting the HUD-designated housing goals was ultimately destabilizing.&quot;  Prefers FHLBanks.

How much competition within mortgage secondary market?  Specialization in secondary mortgage market?  PMI, FHA, Ginnie Mae?

== g Fees ==
Thanks for jogging my memory.

I was wrong in an earlier email about two bills.  The second one died in the 112th, so it is PL 112-78.  The other bill affected VA mortgages, not GSE mortgages.

FHFA’s report (http://www.fhfa.gov/webfiles/24259/Gfee083112.pdf) said that the average g free was 28 basis points in 2011.  Since then there was the PL 112-78 that has added 10 basis points and 10 basis points ordered by FHFA (in the previous press release), which gets the total to 48 basis points.

In case you missed it, American Banker has an article (March 20) say that the MBA, NAHB, and Realtors send a letter opposing increases in the g fees  as limiting policy options.

Of course with the current dividend being paid to Congress being a profit sweep, all the g fees go to Treasury one way or another.

Subject: RE: GSE Guarantor Fee

This seems about right based on testimony from Mel Martinez this week… 

“By comparison, the guarantee fees for mortgages now supported by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are currently in the range of 50 basis points (including a 10 basis point chargepaid to the U.S. Treasuryto financethe payroll tax deduction).

Subject: GSE Guarantor Fee

Hey Eric, 

I hope you’re well.  Just trying to get my ducks in a row as the GSE reform stuff seems to be catching more attention legislatively.  So here’s what I think - 

The g-fee has been increased twice since conservatorship --In Dec. 11 (effective Apr. 12) and Aug. 12 (effective Dec. 12)… and all of that revenue has gone to the general Treasury as per P.L.112-78 and will do so through Oct 2021… CBO scored it $35.7 billion – which seems like the most up-to-date number for the revenue…  So essentially this is 20 total basis points more (0.20 percent) than the 2011 level (which seems to be 28 basis points)…

Thanks for your technical assistance with this stuff.  No timeline, so feel free to respond tomorrow or early next week. 

Thanks,

U.S. secondary mortgage markets. Over the past decade, these institutions have amassed enormous
mortgage- and non-mortgage-oriented investment portfolios that pose significant interest-rate risks to the
companies and a systemic risk to the financial system. This paper describes the nature of these risks and
systemic concerns and then evaluates several policy options for reducing the institutions’ investment
portfolios. We conclude that limits on portfolio size (assets or liabilities) would be the most desirable
approach to mitigating the systemic risk posed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.&lt;/nowiki&gt;

  They did, in 2008, meet their special affordable housing multifamily subgoal.  More on this

*[http://www.michigan.gov/documents/cis_ofis_ip208_24992_7.pdf Homeowners Insurance:] Replacement vs Repair Costs.  Also 80% rule.  Most companies require you to carry insurance equal to at least 80% of the replacement cost of your home or else they will not pay the full cost of repairing, rebuilding, or replacing a partial loss. If you do have a serious or total loss, you will not be paid more than the total amount of the policy.</text>

Eric, 
yes, if you are interested in the Swiss data it is available here:
http://www.snb.ch/en/iabout/stat/statpub/bchpub/stats/bankench
when you look at the swiss dta keep in mind that the composition of domestic assets and liabilities may differe considerably than the composition of total assets and liabilities (domestic &amp; foreign). The reason is that Credit Suisse and UBS do large part of their business abroad .. and this is quite different than theri domestic activities.
 
with regard to the EU the ECB provides summary data for the whole area as well as info on individual countries:
http://sdw.ecb.europa.eu/browse.do?node=2018811
 
(here you should look at &quot;MFI balance sheets&quot;
 
 
hope this is helpful
martin

On an overcast Wednesday morning last month, Boston’s leading asset managers called nine of Wall Street’s top banks to an emergency meeting in a skyscraper overlooking the city’s harbour.

Over back-to-back discussions – with a hurried lunch of sandwiches and biscuits – they tried to tackle one of the toughest problems confronting financiers and, potentially, the broader economy: America’s $8tn corporate debt market is running out of its lifeblood – liquidity.

[[Media:Amherst Mortgage Insight 05302012.pdf|The Coming Crisis in Credit Availability]] Wiki Copy.  Original on H:.  Source:  Amherst Securities.

Credit availability was too loose in the 2005–early 2007 period. Borrowers were able
to buy homes with low (or no) down payments, and very little documentation of
income and assets. In an over-reaction, credit availability is now too tight; it is
increasingly difficult for borrowers who are “outside the credit box” to qualify for a
mortgage, as we quantify by our Credit Availability Index. Our concern is that the
new regulatory actions, many of which are spawned by Dodd-Frank, have the
potential to make credit even tighter. We focus on the Qualified Mortgage (QM) Rule,
the Qualified Residential Mortgage (QRM) Rule, the High Cost Mortgage Rules
(HOEPA) and “disparate impact.” We believe the interaction between these rules is
being ignored, as different regulatory agencies preside over each one.</text>

http://247wallst.com/2011/01/11/underwater-mortgages-measuring-the-unmeasurable/

Hi Kevin,

The best measure that I can get is the dollar size of mortgages, not the number.

The Federal Housing Finance Agency has some spreadsheets on outstanding mortgages as measured by unpaid balance at http://www.fhfa.gov/webfiles/22743/SFMortgagesOutstanding1990to2011Q2rev1122011.xls.  To clarify the terminology, jumbo mortgages are above the conforming loan limit at the time they were taken out (and the $417,000 conforming loan limit has changed, but not since 2008).  Conventional mortgages have not explicit government backing (FHA, VA, USDA are not conventional).  The FHA,VA, and USDA backed mortgages are usually below the conforming loan limit, but currently there is a minor exception in high-cost areas.

For underwater estimates, I'd look at Zillow (http://www.zillow.com/blog/research/2012/08/22/negative-equity-declines-slightly-on-the-back-of-modest-home-value-gains/) and CoreLogic (http://www.corelogic.com/about-us/researchtrends/negative-equity-report.aspx).

Contact me if I can be of further assistance.

Eric

*[http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2008/200829/200829pap.pdf Mayer and Pence:  Subprime Mortgages: What, Where, and to Whom?] &lt;nowiki&gt;We explore the types of data used to characterize risky subprime lending and consider the geographic dispersion of subprime lending. First, we describe the strengths and weaknesses of three different datasets on subprime mortgages using information from LoanPerformance, HUD, and HMDA. These datasets embody different definitions of subprime mortgages. We show that estimates of the number of subprime originations are somewhat sensitive to which types of mortgages are categorized as subprime. Second, we describe what parts of the country and what sorts of neighborhoods had more subprime originations in 2005, and how these patterns differed for purchase and refinance mortgages. Subprime originations appear to be heavily concentrated in fast growing parts of the country with considerable new construction, such as Florida, California, Nevada, and the Washington DC area. These locations saw house prices rise at faster-than-average rates relative to their own history and relative to the rest of the country. However, this link between construction, house prices, and subprime lending is not universal, as other markets with high house price growth such as the Northeast did not see especially high rates of subprime usage. Subprime loans were also heavily concentrated in Zip codes with more residents in the moderate credit score category and more black and Hispanic residents. Areas with lower income and higher unemployment had more subprime lending, but these associations are smaller in magnitude.&lt;/nowiki&gt;

*[http://www.bos.frb.org/economic/ppdp/2009/ppdp0902.pdf Reducing Foreclosures] [http://localhost/docs/FederalReserve/Boston/ppdp0902.pdf (local)]&lt;nowiki&gt;This paper takes a skeptical look at a leading argument about what is causing the foreclosure crisis and what should be done to stop it. We use an economic model to focus on two key decisions: the borrower’s choice to default on the mortgage and the lender’s choice on whether to renegotiate or “modify” the loan. The theoretical model and econometric analysis illustrate that “unaffordable” loans, defined as those with high mortgage payments relative to income at origination, are unlikely to be the main reason that borrowers decide to default.  Rather, the typical problem appears to be a combination of household income shocks and an unprecedented fall in house prices. Regarding the small number of loan modifications to date, we show, both theoretically and empirically, that the efficiency of foreclosure for investors is a more plausible explanation for the low number of modifications than contract frictions related to securitization agreements between servicers and investors. While investors might be foreclosing when it would be socially efficient to modify, there is little evidence to suggest they are acting against their own interests when they do so. An important implication of our analysis is that policies designed to reduce foreclosures should focus on ameliorating the
immediate effects of job loss and other adverse life events, rather than modifying loans to
make them more “affordable” on a long-term basis.&lt;/nowiki&gt;
*[http://www.bos.frb.org/economic/ppdp/2008/ppdp0806.pdf Subprime Mortgages, Foreclosures, and Urban Neighborhoods] [http://localhost/docs/FederalReserve/Boston/ppdp0806.pdf (local)] &lt;nowiki&gt;This paper analyzes the impact of the subprime crisis on urban neighborhoods in Massachusetts. The topic is explored using a dataset that matches race and income information from HMDA with property‐level, transaction data from Massachusetts registry of deeds offices. With these data, we show that much of the subprime lending in the state was concentrated in urban neighborhoods and that minority homeownerships created with subprime mortgages have proven exceptionally unstable in the face of rapid price declines. The evidence from Massachusetts suggests that subprime lending did not, as is commonly believed, lead to a substantial increase in homeownership by minorities, but instead generated turnover in properties owned by minority residents. Furthermore, we argue that the particularly dire foreclosure situation in urban neighborhoods actually makes it somewhat easier for policymakers to provide remedies.&lt;/nowiki&gt;
*[http://www.bos.frb.org/economic/ppdp/2008/ppdp0802.pdf Subprime Facts: What (We Think) We Know about the Subprime Crisis and What We Don’t] [http://localhost/docs/FederalReserve/Boston/ppdp0802.pdf (local)] &lt;nowiki&gt;Using a variety of datasets, we document some basic facts about the current subprime crisis.  Many of these facts are applicable to the crisis at a national level, while some illustrate
problems relevant only to Massachusetts and New England. We conclude by discussing some
outstanding questions about which the data, we believe, are not yet conclusive.&lt;/nowiki&gt;
*[http://www.bos.frb.org/economic/ppdp/2008/ppdp0803.pdf Negative Equity and Foreclosure:  Theory and Evidence] &lt;nowiki&gt;Millions of Americans have negative housing equity, meaning that the outstanding balance on
their mortgage exceeds their home’s current market value. Our data show that the
overwhelming majority of these households will not lose their homes. Our finding is
consistent with historical evidence: we examine more than 100,000 homeowners in
Massachusetts who had negative equity during the early 1990s and find that fewer than 10
percent of these owners eventually lost their home to foreclosure. This result is also, contrary
to popular belief, completely consistent with economic theory, which predicts that from the
borrower’s perspective, negative equity is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for
foreclosure. Our findings imply that lenders and policymakers face a serious information
problem in trying to help borrowers with negative equity, because it is difficult to determine
which borrowers actually require help in order to prevent the loss of their homes to
foreclosure.&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Hi,

Welcome to the Hill!

CRS’s home page is http://www.crs.gov/pages/Default.aspx.  You can only get the full version from the Hill (or office).  

Some of our key resources are…

A list of Congressional liaison offices http://www.crs.gov/resources/Pages/liaisonoffices.aspx
Grants and federal assistance http://www.crs.gov/resources/Pages/CS-Grants.aspx
Casework  http://www.crs.gov/resources/Pages/CS-Casework.aspx

CRS Programs for District Offices http://www.crs.gov/programs/Pages/eventscal_District.aspx  I see there’s a program on grants work on April 17, but not much else.

You might be interested in small business issues.  I used to cover the area, but we’ve got a couple of other analysts working on that now.  CRS has a primer on SBA programs at http://www.crs.gov/products/rl/pdf/RL33243.pdf?Source=search.

The SBA has contracted with a company to put out a magazine on small business programs with information for each state.  The Virginia magazine is at http://smallbusiness3.com/sites/default/files/guide-pdf/english/virginia.pdf.

Finally, our small business team does briefings for staff and if you’re on the Hill they would be happy to talk with you.  Let me know when your on the Hill, and maybe we can have coffee or lunch.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2875">= Refis =

From Mary Ellen Taylor (8/30/2011)

''Why have so few refis been completed with loan-to-value ratios above 105? Have lenders been reluctant to do them (if so, why?) or could Fannie/Freddie be responsible for the roadblocks?

'' A:  HARP loans with LTVs greater than 105 are not TBA eligible and must be placed in pools exclusively comprised of HARP loans with LTV &gt; 105%.  Therefore, they are not as liquid.  Also, originators perceive higher LTV loans as posing more risk to them so homeowners in this situation may be having a tough time finding lenders willing to offer a HARP refinance.  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have no control over the products lenders offer, including HARP refinances.

''Could you explain what the complexity of doing a HARP when mortgage insurance is involved and whether this is a common challenge?

''A: If the loan being refinanced has an LTV &gt; 80% and has mortgage insurance in place, the HARP refinanced loan must also have mortgage insurance in place.  The transfer of the mortgage insurance to the modified loan can be very cumbersome, and some mortgage insurance companies will only insure above 105% LTV if the refinance occurs with the existing lender/servicer.

''Do you think the HARP program has underperformed? Were you expecting more refis?

''A:  Nearly 800,000 homeowners have used HARP to refinance, with more than 8.2 million refinancings taking place through other Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac programs.  There have been challenges.  In general, originators have made different levels of effort to accommodate borrowers who could qualify for HARP.  They have complete discretion as to what parts of HARP they offer to their customers and therefore market the program accordingly.  Originators are less likely to execute a HARP refinance if they are not currently servicing the loan that is being refinanced because it is a more complicated process and they perceive those transactions as more risky to them.  They have also dedicated various levels of operational capacity to originating HARP refinances, which affects the volume of HARP loans they originate.  In addition, there have been numerous structural challenges, such as transfer of MI certificates, limited ability to roll in closing costs, unemployment, and rep and warrants on original value.

''Any concerns about making HARP loans exempt from loan-level pricing adjustments? Would the elimination of these risk-based fees increase the number of HARP refis significantly?

''A: On average, loan-level pricing adjustments have remained well below the current cap.    It is difficult to predict borrower behavior if loan-level pricing adjustments were eliminated.  Also, the elimination of these fees by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would not preclude lenders from pricing HARP products at the same level as other products with LLPAs and retaining those fees.</text>

After United Airlines Flight 175 banked above the harbor behind him, it was pointed at the 50th floor. If not trimmed correctly, an airplane will rise as it accelerates, and the man who had killed and replaced the airplane’s pilot added power until he hit the south tower 24 floors above Newhouse. He doesn’t remember the sound of the impact.

*[http://www.nber.org/papers/w10388 An Empirical Analysis of the Economic Impact of Federal Terrorism Reinsurance]This paper examines the role of the federal government in the market for terrorism reinsurance. We investigate the stock price response of affected industries to a sequence of thirteen events culminating in the enactment of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA) of 2002. In the industries most likely to be affected by TRIA banking, construction, insurance, real estate investment trusts, transportation, and public utilities the stock price effect was primarily negative. The Act was at best value-neutral for property-casualty insurers because it eliminated the option not to offer terrorism insurance. The negative response of the other industries may be attributable to the Act's impeding more efficient private market solutions, failing to address nuclear, chemical, and biological hazards, and reducing market expectations of federal assistance following future terrorist attacks.

*Dealer floor plan
The basic SBA 7(a) loan limits are codified in 15 USC 636(a)(2).  A public copy of this is available at [http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/15C14A.txt], but it takes time for updates and this does not include changes made by ARRA (PL 111-5).

The Code of Federal Regulations sets the definition of &quot;small business&quot; (size standard) in several places.  For financial programs it is at 13 CFR 121.301 ([http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2009/janqtr/pdf/13cfr121.301.pdf]).  The SBA announced that it would use (b)(2) for the dealer floor plan program.  For non-financial programs, 13 CFR 121.201 would apply ([http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2009/janqtr/pdf/13cfr121.201.pdf]).  If you search for NAICS code 441110, you will see that for new car dealers, small is defined as annual revenue of $29 million or less.

The SBA announced their use of the alternative size standard in a [http://www.sba.gov/idc/groups/public/documents/sba_homepage/news_release_09-25.pdf   press release], and in the [http://frwebgate3.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/PDFgate.cgi?WAISdocID=8835627399+0+2+0&amp;WAISaction=retrieve   Federal Register].

The SBA's web page on the dealer floor plan at [http://www.sba.gov/floorplanfinancing/index.html] has more information.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3701">== SEC Suit Against Mudd, Syron, et al. ==

The SEC sued former executives of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac based on their disclosures about the GSEs’ exposure to subprime loans.  The two companies were not sued, and have agreed to cooperate with the SEC.

The Fannie Mae [http://sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2011/comp-pr2011-267-fanniemae.pdf suit] is against Daniel Mudd, former CEO; Enrico Dallavecchia, former Chief Risk Officer; and Thomas Lund, former Single-Family Credit Guarantee EVP.  The SEC alleges that from December 6, 2006 through August 8, 2008, Fannie Mae repeatedly underdisclosed its subprime exposure.  The SEC alleges that Fannie Mae used a disclosed definition of subprime, but that in calculating its exposure, it excluded expanded approval (EA) loans and MyCommunityMortgage (MCM) loans, which the SEC says “fell squarely within Fannie Mae’s publicly stated definition of subprime[.]”  After Fannie Mae was in conservatorship, the SEC says that Fannie Mae for the first time publicly acknowledged that it held loans that matched its definition of Alt-A that it had not reported in its Alt-A exposure.  The SEC also alleges that Fannie Mae disclosed that it classified loans as Alt-A if the lender delivering the loans did so, but that Fannie Mae did not disclose that it directed lenders whether to label reduced-documentation loans as Alt-A.  The complaint also includes statements that it says Mudd made to Congress in April 2007, including that “less than 2.5 percent of our book can be defined as subprime.”  The SEC alleges its subprime exposure was actually considerably higher.

The Freddie Mac [http://sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2011/comp-pr2011-267-freddiemac.pdf suit] is against Richard Syron, former CEO, Patricia Cook, former EVP of Investments and Capital Markets, and Chief Business Officer, and Donald Bisenius, former SVP of Credit Policy and Portfolio Management.  The SEC alleges that from March 23, 2007 through August 6, 2008, Freddie Mac similarly underreported its subprime exposure.  It alleges that the defendants were aware the Freddie Mac was increasing its exposure to lower quality loans, but its public disclosures were inconsistent with how management characterized its use of the term “subprime” for its board members.  The SEC alleges that Syron and Cook were given reports that the 2007 book performance was worse than in 2006, and that October 2007 expected default costs “are 76% higher than in 2006[.]”  The SEC alleges that Syron and Cook said in 2007 that Freddie Mac had “basically no subprime exposure in our guarantee business, and about $124 billion of AAA rated subprime exposure in our retained portfolio.”  The complaint alleges that in December 2007, Syron said, “we didn’t buy any subprime loans.  I mean, we bought some securities, which we can go through, and we think we’re fine in.  We bought them for goal purposes.  But we didn’t buy in guarantee, essentially any subprime loans.  So we weren’t in that business.”  The SEC alleges that at the time, Freddie Mac had $206 billion of exposure to loans that it internally recognized as “subprime,” “otherwise subprime,” or “subprime-like.”

Several models have been developed to calculate cash flow. Each uses expectations of mortgage repayments together with price to determine yield. Fannie Mae does not recommend any particular model and no guaranty can be made that the use of a particular model will be beneficial to an investor. The major difference among these methods is the assumption or methodology used to forecast how quickly principal will be returned. Market analysts and research departments at major investment firms continually monitor mortgage prepayment activity. Extensive prepayment histories are publicly available through these firms. Constant Prepayment Rate (CPR) and Bond Market Association Standard Prepayment Model (PSA curve) are the most popular models used to measure prepayments. CPR represents the annualized constant rate of principal repayment in excess of scheduled principal amortization. The PSA curve is a schedule of prepayments that assumes that prepayments will occur at a rate of 0.2 percent CPR in the first month and will increase an additional 0.2 percent CPR each month until the 30th month and will prepay at a rate of 6 percent CPR thereafter (&quot;100 percent PSA&quot;). PSA prepayment speeds are expressed as a multiple of this base scenario. For example, 200 percent PSA assumes annual prepayment rates will be twice as fast in each of these periods -- 0.4 percent in the first month, 0.8 percent in the second month, reaching 12 percent in month 30 and remaining at 12 percent after that. A zero percent PSA assumes no prepayments.</text>

HMDA coverage of the primary and secondary market has been debated for several years. Berkovec and Zorn (1996) conclude that 1992 and 1993 HMDA data cover 66 percent and 70 percent of Freddie Mac purchases. Inside Mortgage Finance (September 6, 1996), however, reports that 1995 HMDA numbers are within one percent of originations reported by HUD’s Survey of Mortgage Lending. Recently, Fannie Mae stated that “HMDA data is seriously flawed” and “notoriously unreliable in tracking secondary market activity”. We disagree with Fannie Mae’s harsh criticism of HMDA data. Bunce and Scheessele (1996), The GSEs’ Funding of Affordable Loans, provide a good discussion of the limitations of HMDA data and include a discussion of HMDA’s under-reporting of GSE purchases. Bunce and Scheessele conclude that HMDA is the most comprehensive data base available for estimating the market shares for primary and secondary mortgage market activity.

This report will help to expand what is known by looking at lending practices in the subprime mortgage market and the current and potential role of Fannie Mac and Freddie Mac. The report is based on a review of relevant literature and a series of interviews with subprime and prime lenders and representatives of consumer groups, regulators, investment banks and trade associations.

From the struggle to enact fair housing and fair lending legislation in the 1960s to the community-based advocacy that prompted Congress to pass the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) and the Community Reinvestment Act in the 1970s, housing and civil rights advocates have pursued a common goal of eradicating racial discrimination in home mortgage lending. Today, the fight continues as housing advocates seek to expand regulatory and legislative action to halt predatory lending practices that burden many minorities with mortgages they cannot afford and often do not need.

*[https://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/review/06/01/ChomPennCross.pdf The Evolution of the Subprime Mortgage Market] This paper describes subprime lending in the mortgage market and how it has evolved through time. Subprime lending has introduced a substantial amount of risk-based pricing into the mortgage market by creating a myriad of prices and product choices largely determined by borrower credit history (mortgage and rental payments, foreclosures and bankruptcies, and overall credit scores) and down payment requirements. Although subprime lending still differs from prime lending in many ways, much of the growth (at least in the securitized portion of the market) has come in the least-risky (A–) segment of the market. In addition, lenders have imposed prepayment penalties to extend the duration of loans and required larger down payments to lower their credit risk exposure from high-risk loans.

*[http://www.woodstockinst.org/publications/download/two-steps-back%3a-the-dual-mortgage-market,-predatory-lending-and-the-undoing-of-community-development/ Two Steps Back] In the last few years, predatory mortgage lending has become an increasingly critical issue facing those working to promote community reinvestment. Predatory lending practices include, but are not limited to, fraudulent, high-pressure, or misleading marketing and sales; the “packing” and financing of unnecessary fees; and “flipping” or overly frequent refinancing with fees being repeatedly rolled into the loan. These and similar practices are threatening years of community development progress across the country. The restructuring of financial services industries and the failure of federal and state regulators to respond to these changes have increased the ability of certain lenders and brokers to exploit homeowners, particularly in minority and modest-income communities. This report describes predatory lending, identifies some explanations for its growth in recent years, quantifies the hypersegmentation of lending by neighborhood racial composition, and calls for a set of policy changes to curb abuses.</text>

Understanding the Subprime Mortgage Crisis
http://research.stlouisfed.org/wp/2008/2008-036.pdf


Our principal data source is the ABS Database from Corelogic-LoanPerformance (hereafter,
LP) data repository containing loan-level data on securitized mortgages.4 We restrict our
analysis to loan-level data on over nine million .rst-lien securitized subprime mortgages,
originated between 2000 and 2006.5 Signi.cantly, our study comprises of originations that
were securitized and within the securitized subprime universe, the coverage on these loans
are fairly high especially for the later cohorts. Summary data on subprime originations
over the years record a signi.cant increase in the proportion of adjustable rate mortgages
(mainly hybrid-ARMs). In addition, these years saw a sharp increase in the proportion of
low-documentation loans and a signi.cant deterioration in loan-to-value ratios (see GAO,
2010 for details). Interestingly however, and contrary to perceived wisdom, this deteriora-
tion of loan quality was hardly a secular trend. As mentioned earlier, we draw attention to
two patterns that went against this trend. First, we demonstrate that there was a signi.-
cant increase in the credit quality on subprime originations as measured by their origination
FICO scores. We also note that this change is a subprime phenomenon and not a result 
of changes in creditworthiness of the U.S. population. Second, we examine the minimum
criterion for obtaining a subprime loan in terms of origination characteristics over the two
periods. We find that in terms of some basic observable origination characteristics, the
minimum criterion to obtain a subprime loan actually strengthened over the two periods.

Subject: I might have found it!!!

Gents,

Check out page 30 of this TCW group report at https://www.tcw.com/News_and_Commentary/News/Webcast_Schedule_Replays/~/media/Downloads/News/ConferenceCalls/080910TSI.ashx.   It appears that the FICO scores and LTVs remained fairly stable until after 2008 when FHA's business started to ramp up.  At any rate, before Susan Watcher tries to show that credit standards were loosened, it would help if she might make an attempt to reconcile some of the info that we have on credit scores &amp; DTI ratios.  Supposedly, if we were living in a world of risk-based pricing and automated underwriting (credit scores), then it theoretically should have been OK to require lower down payments.  So she may be correct, but it would help to tell a better, more complete story.

Thanks for everyone's help!!!
DG


== Underwriting Standards == 

Hello Eric,

I apologize again for the delay this morning.  Here is the study done by UNC and CRL that I referenced:
http://www.ccc.unc.edu/abstracts/QRMunderwriting.php

Carolina Reid works for CRL and was one of the authors.  
Carolina K. Reid
Senior Researcher
Center for Responsible Lending
1330 Broadway, Suite #604
Oakland, CA 94612
Phone: 510-379-5524

This piece from the FHFA might be of some help in documenting the rise of low FICO, high LTV as a share of the GSE and PLS market.  The data is in the index at the back.

http://www.fhfa.gov/webfiles/16711/RiskChars9132010.pdf

Also, the GAO did a study on the impact of QRM and QM and estimated market share of loans that would have been excluded by QM.  Because of limitations in the data, they could only quantify a few of the restrictions (pages 22-24).  Perhaps the UNC data set might be more robust.

http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d11656.pdf  

I hope that this helps.
