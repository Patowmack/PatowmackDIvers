Divers know our reefs are under threat, but you can help protect them
(and yourself) every time you apply sunscreen. Ingredients like
oxybenzone, parabens and mineral oils in sunscreens and body-care
products can harm our oceans, rivers, lakes and streams. Studies have
shown that coral-reef damage can be caused by these ingredients and they
are making their way into the waterways and popular reefs in
surprisingly high concentrations. Join us as we welcome Mike Materre,
Vice President of Stream2Sea, who will tell the story of the development
of this reef-safe sunscreen and body-care products company founded in
2015 by Autumn Blum, a cosmetic chemist and scuba diver. Where: Zoom
information will be sent at a later time.
